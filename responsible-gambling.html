                  <p class="mb-4">At onlinecasinomrbet.com, operated by <span class="accent-keyword">Mr Bet online
                      casino</span> , we are fully committed to promoting responsible gambling practices and creating a
                    safe and enjoyable environment for all our players. While we want you to have fun, we also recognize
                    that gambling can sometimes lead to problems for a small number of individuals. This policy outlines
                    our commitment to preventing problem gambling and providing tools and support to those who need it.
                  </p>

                  <h2 class="mb-3">1. Our Commitment to Responsible Gambling</h2>
                  <ul class="list-unstyled mb-4">
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Protecting Minors:</strong> We strictly prohibit anyone under the legal
                      gambling age (18 or the age of majority in their jurisdiction, whichever is higher) from
                      registering an account or playing on our platform. We employ robust age verification processes.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Preventing Problem Gambling:</strong> We actively work to prevent
                      compulsive gambling and provide support to those who may be developing gambling problems.</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Secure Environment:</strong> We ensure a secure and private gaming
                      environment.</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Fair Play:</strong> We are committed to fair and transparent gaming.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h2 class="mb-3">2. Tools for Responsible Gambling</h2>
                  <p>We provide various tools and features to help you manage your gambling effectively:</p>
                  <ul class="list-unstyled mb-4">
                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Self-Exclusion:</strong> If you feel you need a break from gambling, you
                      can choose to self-exclude from our services for a specified period (e.g., 6 months, 1 year, 5
                      years, or permanently). During this period, you will not be able to log in, deposit, or receive
                      marketing communications from us. To activate self-exclusion, please contact our Customer Support
                      team.</li>
                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Deposit Limits:</strong> You can set daily, weekly, or monthly deposit
                      limits on your account. Once a limit is set, you will not be able to deposit more than the
                      specified amount within the chosen timeframe. You can adjust these limits at any time; however,
                      increasing a limit will usually take a grace period to become effective (e.g., 24-72 hours) to
                      allow you to reconsider. Decreasing a limit typically takes effect immediately.</li>
                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Loss Limits:</strong> Similar to deposit limits, you can set limits on the
                      amount of money you are willing to lose over a specific period.</li>
                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Session Limits / Reality Checks:</strong> You can set a time limit for your
                      gaming sessions. Once this limit is reached, a pop-up notification will appear, reminding you of
                      the time you've spent playing and giving you the option to continue or log out.</li>
                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Account History:</strong> You can easily access your transaction and gaming
                      history in your account section. This allows you to monitor your deposits, withdrawals, bets, and
                      losses over time.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>How to Set Limits or Self-Exclude:</strong></p>
                  <p class="mb-4">You can usually find these options within your account settings under a "Responsible
                    Gaming" or "Limits" section. If you cannot find them or need assistance, please contact our Customer
                    Support team, who will be happy to guide you through the process.</p>

                  <h2 class="mb-3">3. Identifying Problem Gambling</h2>
                  <p>Gambling should be an entertaining pastime, not a source of stress or financial difficulty. Here
                    are some signs that gambling may be becoming a problem:</p>
                  <ul class="mb-4">
                    <li>Spending more money and time on gambling than you can afford.</li>
                    <li>Chasing losses (trying to win back money you've lost).</li>
                    <li>Neglecting responsibilities (work, family, social life) due to gambling.</li>
                    <li>Lying about your gambling activities.</li>
                    <li>Feeling anxious, stressed, or irritable when you can't gamble.</li>
                    <li>Borrowing money or selling possessions to gamble.</li>
                    <li>Gambling affecting your relationships with others.</li>
                    <li>Difficulty stopping or controlling your gambling.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="mb-4">If you recognize any of these signs in yourself or someone you know, it's important to
                    seek help.</p>

                  <h2 class="mb-3">4. External Help and Support</h2>
                  <p>We encourage anyone concerned about their gambling habits to seek independent professional help.
                    There are many organizations dedicated to assisting individuals with problem gambling:</p>
                  <ul class="list-unstyled mb-4">
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Gamblers Anonymous:</strong> A fellowship of men and women who share their
                      experience, strength, and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help
                      others to recover from a gambling problem. (www.gamblersanonymous.org)</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>GamCare (UK):</strong> Provides support, information, and advice to anyone
                      experiencing problems with gambling. (www.gamcare.org.uk)</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Gambling Therapy:</strong> A global service providing free practical advice
                      and emotional support to anyone affected by problem gambling. (www.gamblingtherapy.org)</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>National Council on Problem Gambling (USA):</strong> Provides a national
                      helpline and resources for problem gamblers and their families. (www.ncpgambling.org)</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">[Add relevant local support organizations here based on your target audience's
                      regions - e.g., "GambleAware (Australia)", "Responsible Gambling Council (Canada)", etc.]</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h2 class="mb-3">5. Protecting Minors</h2>
                  <p>We use sophisticated verification systems to ensure that no one under the age of 18 (or the legal
                    age of majority in their jurisdiction) can access our services.</p>
                  <p class="mb-4">Parents and guardians can use filtering software to prevent minors from accessing
                    gambling sites. Examples include Net Nanny (www.netnanny.com) and Cyber Patrol
                    (www.cyberpatrol.com).</p>

                  <h2 class="mb-3">6. Our Customer Support Team</h2>
                  <p class="mb-4">Our dedicated Customer Support team is trained to assist you with responsible gambling
                    inquiries. They can provide information on our responsible gambling tools, guide you through setting
                    limits, or initiate a self-exclusion. While they cannot provide professional advice on problem
                    gambling, they can direct you to appropriate support organizations.</p>

                  <p><strong>Contact Us:</strong></p>
                  <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding responsible gambling, or if you need assistance
